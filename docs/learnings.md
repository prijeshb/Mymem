# MyMem — Learnings, Errors & Evals

A living log of mistakes made, lessons learned, and feature delivery assessments.

---

## [2026-04-21] Web Search for Related Links (Phase 1)

**Feature requested:** Backend searches the web for related concepts, ranks by relevance, returns top 3.

**Delivered:**
- ✅ `mymem/pipeline/search.py` — DDG search + word-overlap cosine scoring + Wikipedia fallback
- ✅ Results cached in-process per session
- ✅ SSE streams results per concept as they arrive
- ❌ First attempt used `duckduckgo-search` package (now renamed to `ddgs`) — caught by runtime test
- ❌ Used `structlog` in search.py which wasn't available in test env — should use stdlib `logging`

**Lessons:**
- Always `python -c` test external packages before wiring them in.
- Use stdlib `logging` in new pipeline modules unless structlog is confirmed available.
- **Present plan + wait for confirmation before coding any new feature.**

---

## [2026-04-21] Related Concepts Web Links

**Feature requested:** Related concepts in WikiPage should show web search results (not just static URLs).

**What was delivered vs asked:**
- ✅ Wikipedia API search integrated
- ✅ SSE streaming so page doesn't block
- ✅ Popover on broken wikilinks showing Wikipedia results
- ❌ First attempt used wrong Wikipedia User-Agent → 403 errors, feature appeared broken
- ❌ Initial static URLs (`duckduckgo.com/?q=...`) were passed as "web links" with no actual search — user had to point this out
- ❌ Jumped to implementation of `duckduckgo-search` package without presenting plan first

**Errors made:**
1. Used `MyMem/0.1 (knowledge-bot)` as User-Agent for Wikipedia API → blocked with 403. Fix: use Mozilla-compatible UA.
2. Generated static search URLs without actually fetching results — presented as "web links" which confused the user.
3. Started coding before explaining plan when user asked for a new feature.

**Lessons:**
- Always test external API calls (`python -c "..."`) before wiring them into the backend.
- "Web links" means real fetched results, not generated URLs.
- **Always present plan and get confirmation before implementation.**
- Create `docs/` and plan files for every new feature.

## [2026-04-21] Broken Wikilink Behavior

**Feature requested:** Broken `[[wikilinks]]` should not show raw brackets and should search the web.

**What was delivered:**
- ✅ Stripped `[[` / `]]` from link display text
- ✅ Popover with Wikipedia results on click
- ❌ First delivered DuckDuckGo redirect (wrong) — user wanted inline results, not redirect

**Lesson:** Read the full intent: "search and show results" ≠ "redirect to search engine".

---

## [2026-04-21] Date Bug (created/updated = article publication date)

**Root cause:** `_COMPILE_SYSTEM` prompt told LLM to write `created`/`updated` in frontmatter → LLM used article's pub date. `_strip_frontmatter` sometimes failed (code block wrapping).

**Fix:** Removed dates from LLM prompt. Added `dataclasses.replace(page, updated=date.today())` in `write_page` as a guaranteed stamp.

**Lesson:** Never let LLM control system metadata (dates, IDs). Always override in code.

---

## [2026-04-21] 403 on Webpage Ingest

**Root cause:** httpx was using `User-Agent: MyMem/0.1 (knowledge-bot)` → blocked by sites like DataCenterDynamics.

**Fix:** Switched to Chrome-compatible UA + Accept headers. Added friendly 403 error message pointing user to paste-text fallback.

**Lesson:** Any HTTP client fetching public web pages must use a browser-like UA.

---

## [2026-04-21] Wiki Page Layout & Related Web Articles

**Feature requested:** Related Concepts in wiki page sidebar, web article links loaded async via SSE.

**What was delivered vs asked:**
- ✅ Left sidebar: TOC + Backlinks + Related Concepts (internal wikilinks as indigo links, broken as amber links to internal slug)
- ✅ Related Web Articles as full-width card grid below article body
- ✅ SSE always fires — page title used as primary concept so seed is never empty
- ✅ Sidebar logic extracted into `WikiSidePane` component (modular file structure)
- ❌ Multiple layout iterations needed before landing on correct structure (right sidebar → subsection → left sidebar)
- ❌ `allWebLinks` variable left unused after removing central section — caught and cleaned up

**Errors made:**
1. SSE not firing: guard `if (!seed.length) return` blocked SSE when pages had no `[[wikilinks]]`. Fix: always seed with page title.
2. `IndexEntry.path` is relative — `e.path.stat().st_mtime` resolved from wrong directory. Fix: `(wiki_dir / e.path).stat().st_mtime`.
3. Related Concepts filtered to `r.internal` only — hid broken wikilinks from sidebar. Fix: show all, style differently.
4. `Link` import left in `WikiPage.tsx` after moving sidebar to `WikiSidePane` — removed.

**Lessons:**
- Always seed SSE with at least one guaranteed concept (page title) so the stream fires even on pages with no wikilinks.
- `IndexEntry.path` from `index.md` is relative — always resolve against `wiki_dir` before calling filesystem methods.
- Extract sidebar/panel logic into dedicated components early — modular file structure rule applies.
- Save user's memory preference: always use modular file structure (one purpose per file).

## [2026-04-21] Security Audit — Input Validation & Injection Prevention

**Finding:** `mymem/security/` has well-built `validate.py` and `sanitize.py` — but **neither is wired into the actual pipeline or API routes**. The security layer exists in isolation.

**Critical gaps found:**
- Prompt injection: `sanitize_for_prompt()` / `sanitize_query()` exist but never called — raw user content goes directly into LLM prompts in both `ingest.py` and `query.py`
- Path traversal: `/api/page/{slug:path}` allows slashes; no `relative_to()` boundary check before file read
- Path traversal: `slug_to_path()` uses raw user question in filenames when saving Q&A pages
- API validation bypass: `api.py` defines loose Pydantic models instead of using the strict ones in `security/validate.py`
- File upload: `file.filename` suffix used directly to create temp file — no sanitization

**What is safe:**
- SQL injection: parameterized queries everywhere
- Command injection: no shell/subprocess calls anywhere

**Fix order:**
1. Path traversal in `api_page()` — add `path.resolve().is_relative_to(wiki_dir.resolve())` check
2. Prompt injection in `query.py` — call `sanitize_query()` before LLM
3. Prompt injection in `ingest.py` — call `sanitize_for_prompt()` before LLM
4. Replace loose API models with `security/validate.py` models
5. Sanitize `slug_to_path()` output

**See full audit:** `docs/security_audit.md`

**Lesson:** Writing security utilities is not enough — they must be imported and called at every entry point. Wire them in during initial implementation, not as an afterthought.

## [2026-05-05] PDF Ingestion — Chunking Strategy & Pipeline Order

**Context:** User uploaded a 100-page PDF via the Upload File tab and asked why chunking happens after idea extraction, and whether there's a better approach.

**How the pipeline actually works (two separate chunking steps):**
1. **LLM chunking** (`ChunkSplitter(max_tokens=6000)`) — splits raw PDF text so it fits the model's context window. Ideas are extracted per chunk. This runs *before* idea extraction.
2. **RAG chunking** (`_rag_index_pdf`) — re-chunks the same PDF into small overlapping windows, embeds them with `nomic-embed-text`, stores in `rag.db` for vector search. This runs *after* wiki pages are written because it's a separate concern (retrieval index, not knowledge extraction).

**The real problem — `max_tokens=6000` is far too conservative:**
- The compile model (`gemma4:12b`) has a 128k context window.
- A 100-page PDF is ~100k tokens.
- At 6000 tokens/chunk that's ~17 LLM calls, each blind to the others, producing duplicates.
- Simply raising the limit to match the model's actual context reduces this to 1–2 calls.

**User's suggestion — "chunk first, find relevant chunk, pass to LLM":**
This is RAG-for-ingestion. Works well for *querying* (you have a specific question). For *ingestion* it has a chicken-and-egg problem: you don't know which topics to retrieve for before you've read the document. The goal of ingestion is to extract *everything*, not answer a specific question.

**Recommended approach (ranked):**
1. **Raise `max_tokens` to model-aware sizing** — fixes 99% of cases immediately. No architecture change needed.
2. **Structure-aware chunking** — split on PDF headings/sections instead of arbitrary token counts. More coherent ideas per chunk. Better for books/technical papers.
3. **Two-pass outline → targeted extract** — fast cheap LLM produces outline first, then extract ideas per section. Best quality but more complex.

**Uploaded file storage bug fixed alongside this:**
Files uploaded via `/api/upload` were written to `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` and deleted after ingestion. RAG stores the file path — deleting it breaks future RAG lookups. Fix: save to `raw/<source_type_subdir>/filename` permanently.

**Lessons:**
- Two chunking steps serve different purposes — don't conflate LLM context chunking with RAG retrieval chunking.
- RAG-for-ingestion (retrieve-then-extract) solves a different problem than full-document knowledge extraction.
- Chunk size limits must be set relative to the model's actual context window, not a generic conservative default.
- Uploaded files must persist if any downstream system (RAG) stores their path.

## [2026-05-19] Dashboard Layout — Iterative UI Positioning

**Feature requested:** Reorganise dashboard panels multiple times across a session.

**What was learned:**
- User iterated layout 6+ times in one session: bottom-center → 3-col grid → slide-in panel → button placement
- Each iteration was a small targeted diff — the right approach. No full rewrites.
- "Move X to top-right corner" with "outside the card" means a standalone element above the card with `flex justify-end`, not `absolute` positioning.
- "Like Claude Code desktop" = fixed-width side panel (`w-[420px]`) that slides in via `transition-all duration-300`, with its own scroll, sticky header, and close button — not a modal or overlay.
- Answer output that "renders whole content" = needs `max-h-[Xvh] overflow-y-auto` to cap growth.
- `max-w-7xl` on `<main>` was the root cause of blank side margins — upgrade to `max-w-screen-2xl`.
- `h-[calc(100vh-56px-2rem)]` on the dashboard container (navbar height + padding) gives a full-height panel layout without page scroll.

**Lessons:**
- For slide-in panels: use `w-0` → `w-[Npx]` with `overflow-hidden` on the outer div; inner div is fixed at `w-[Npx]` so content doesn't reflow during animation.
- Always check `<main>` max-width before assuming the layout is the problem.
- Scrollable answer areas need explicit max-height — they won't self-limit inside a flex container.

## [2026-05-05] RAG Chunking Strategy Reference

**Context:** Evaluating chunking options for the local wiki + PDF RAG system.

**Chunking types and their fit:**

| Type | How it works | Best for |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Fixed-size | Split every N chars/tokens | Simple docs, prototypes |
| Fixed-size + overlap | Fixed-size but repeats some text between chunks | General RAG, reduces lost context |
| Sentence | Split on sentence boundaries | Clean prose, articles, notes |
| Paragraph | Split on blank lines | Markdown, docs, essays |
| Markdown/header | Split on `#`, `##`, `###` headings | Wikis, documentation, Obsidian |
| Semantic | Group by meaning/topic similarity | Long mixed-topic documents |
| Recursive | Large boundaries first → smaller: section → paragraph → sentence → tokens | General-purpose RAG |
| Sliding window | Moving window with overlap | Dense technical text, transcripts |
| Parent-child | Search small chunks, return larger parent section | Best retrieval quality for docs/wiki |
| Q&A | Convert sections to generated Q&A pairs | FAQ-style retrieval |
| Metadata-aware | Chunks include title, tags, source, heading path, dates | Wikis, enterprise docs |
| Code | Split by functions/classes/modules | Source code RAG |
| Table-aware | Keep rows + headers + captions together | CSVs, reports, financial docs |
| Document-layout | Use page layout: headings, columns, figures | PDFs, scanned docs |

**Best strategy for a local wiki RAG system (ranked):**
1. Markdown/header chunking
2. Parent-child chunking
3. Metadata-aware chunking
4. Recursive chunking as fallback

**Ideal default:**
- Split by Markdown headings
- Target 300–800 tokens per chunk
- 50–150 token overlap
- Store metadata: page title, file path, tags, heading path, modified date
- Retrieve small chunks → return parent section/page when answering

**Current implementation (`mymem/rag/pdf_parser.py`):**
- Paragraph-aware fixed-size sliding window: 800 chars, 80 char overlap
- Tracks `page_num` and `chunk_index` per chunk
- **Gap:** No heading-path metadata, no parent-child relationship, no title/tags stored with chunks
- **Improvement:** Switch to document-layout + metadata-aware for PDFs; markdown/header + parent-child for wiki pages

**Example of ideal chunk metadata:**
```
page: "Local RAG System"
heading_path: "Embedding Models > Quantization"
file_path: raw/papers/rag-survey.pdf
tags: [ml, embeddings]
modified: 2026-05-05
text: <300-800 token chunk>
```

## [2026-06-01] Agent Decomposition — Tool Calls vs Micro-Agents

**Context:** Researched how to break the monolithic ingest/query/eval/introspect pipelines into agents.

**First design (wrong):** 14 micro-agents — one per pipeline stage (SourceReaderAgent, SecurityScannerAgent, ChunkerAgent, IdeaExtractorAgent, PageCompilerAgent, etc.). Each was a separate agent class with message-passing between them.

**Why it was wrong:**
- In PydanticAI, `@agent.tool def read_source(...)` IS the SourceReaderAgent. The LLM calls tools at runtime — there's no need for a separate agent class per stage.
- Micro-agents-as-pipeline-stages is the LangChain/graph mental model, not the tool-call mental model.
- Over-engineering: a ChunkerAgent that has no LLM and no tool calls is just a function — calling it an "agent" adds zero value.

**Correct design: 4 agents + 2 background subagents**

| Type | Name | Has LLM? | How it works |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| Agent | `IngestAgent` | Yes | LLM calls tools: read, scan, extract, write, index |
| Agent | `QueryAgent` | Yes | LLM calls tools: search_index, search_rag, synthesize |
| Agent | `EvalAgent` | Optional | LLM calls tools: quality, retrieval, ragas judge |
| Agent | `IntrospectAgent` | Yes | LLM calls tools: read_log, curiosity, summarize |
| Subagent | `RagIndexSubagent` | No | Plain async function — no reasoning needed |
| Subagent | `ExtractionEvalSubagent` | No (uses reference model directly) | Plain async function |

**Rule learned: background work is not an agent.** If a task doesn't require LLM reasoning to decide what to do next, it's a function, not an agent. RAG indexing and extraction eval run deterministically once triggered — they belong in `background.py` as plain `async def`, wrapped in `_run_background()` for failure isolation.

**Framework chosen: PydanticAI** over LangGraph/CrewAI:
- Async-first, strict mypy, zero hidden globals
- `@agent.tool` replaces manual dispatch tables
- Injects `ModelRouter` as a dependency — no provider lock-in
- `TestModel` from `pydantic_ai.models.test` enables full agent tests without hitting Ollama

**Migration is two phases:**
1. Phase 1 (stdlib only): replace sequential loops with `asyncio.TaskGroup`, parallelize Index+RAG search, replace `ensure_future()` with `_run_background()`
2. Phase 2 (PydanticAI): extract 4 agents + 2 subagents into `mymem/agents/` (6 files total)

**Lessons:**
- Tool calls replace micro-agents. One capable agent with N tools beats N single-purpose mini-agents.
- Ask "does this need LLM reasoning to decide what to do?" — if no, it's a function, not an agent.
- Phase 1 (TaskGroup parallelism) delivers most of the latency win with zero new dependencies.
- Always count agents before finalising an architecture — if you have more agents than LLM-reasoning steps, you have too many.

## [2026-06-01] Storage Format — Markdown vs HTML for LLM Wikis

**Decision:** Store wiki pages as Markdown + YAML frontmatter. Never HTML.

**Why:** Markdown is 60–90% more token-efficient than HTML. LLMs write correct Markdown more reliably than well-formed HTML. YAML frontmatter parses with `yaml.safe_load()` — one line. HTML metadata requires DOM parsing or fragile regex. Every major LLM-powered wiki (Obsidian, Logseq, Foam, Karpathy's LLM Wiki) uses Markdown.

**Rule:** HTML is a rendering target (React + marked.js), never a storage format.

---

## [2026-06-01] Obsidian Integration — Zero Code Required

**Finding:** MyMem's `wiki/` directory and Obsidian vaults use identical formats (Markdown + YAML frontmatter + `[[wikilinks]]`). No sync layer, no file watcher, no plugin needed.

**Integration:** Open Obsidian → "Open folder as vault" → `wiki/`. Or create a Windows directory junction (no admin needed):
```
mymem obsidian setup --vault-path PATH
```

**Lesson:** Before building an integration, check if the formats are already compatible. "Integration" sometimes means pointing at the existing folder.

## [2026-06-22] MCP Access Layer (ADR-017) — serving the wiki to other agents, and the Claude-Desktop launch gotchas

**Feature delivered:** `mymem/interop/mcp/` — a FastMCP server exposing the wiki as MCP tools
(`search_wiki`, `get_page`, `ask`, `list_concepts`, `knowledge_gaps`) + resources (`okf://index`,
`okf://concept/{slug}`), with **OKF v0.1 concepts as the payload format** (reuses ADR-016). CLI
`mymem mcp serve` (stdio default; `--transport http` token-gated). Pure handlers delegate to existing
internals; 27 tests; works in Claude Desktop / Claude Code / MCP Inspector.

**Design that paid off:**
- **Keep handlers pure, isolate the framework.** `tools.py`/`resources.py`/`auth.py` import no
  `fastmcp`; only `server.py` does (lazy import). The whole tool surface is unit-testable without the
  dependency and without a live LLM (inject a fake router for `ask`). The optional dep group
  `mcp = [fastmcp>=3.4,<4]` keeps core install/CI free of it.
- **MCP is the channel, OKF is the schema.** Returning OKF concepts (not bespoke JSON) means any
  OKF-aware consumer understands the payload regardless of transport. Two standards compose.
- **Verify at three levels:** in-memory `Client(server)` (fast, deterministic), spawned-stdio client
  (proves the real process + stdout channel), and HTTP smoke (proves transport + auth). Each caught
  bugs the others missed.

**Three production bugs found only by actually launching it in Claude Desktop (Windows):**

1. **Claude Desktop ignores the `cwd` field** in the stdio server config (build 1.13576). The server
   was spawned from a Windows system dir, so relative paths (`wiki/`, `data/`, `config.yaml`) didn't
   resolve and `ensure_dirs()` died with `PermissionError: Access is denied: 'raw'`. **Fix:** the
   server must anchor itself — `mcp serve` now resolves a project root (`MYMEM_PROJECT_DIR` env, else
   the editable-install package location validated by `pyproject.toml`/`wiki/` markers) and `os.chdir`s
   to it **before** loading settings. Also set `MYMEM_PROJECT_DIR` in the config `env` as a guaranteed
   signal. Don't rely on the MCP host's `cwd`.

2. **On stdio, stdout IS the JSON-RPC channel — never print to it.** A single
   `console.print("MyMem MCP server…")` (Rich `Console()` → stdout) corrupted the protocol:
   the client threw `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'M', "MyMem MCP "... is not valid JSON` and
   disconnected. **Fix:** route all status/logs to **stderr** (`Console(stderr=True)`) and pass
   `server.run(show_banner=False)` to suppress FastMCP's stdout banner. (The Rich log handler was
   already on stderr — only the one stray print broke it.)

3. **Logging must never crash the process.** `configure_logging` did
   `log_file.parent.mkdir(...)` unguarded; under a protected CWD that raised `PermissionError` and
   killed the server before it could serve. **Fix:** wrap the file-handler setup in `try/except OSError`
   and degrade to console-only with a warning. A logging sink failure must be non-fatal.

**Security finding (F3) — startup auth ≠ per-request auth.** The HTTP transport was fail-closed at
*startup* (won't start without `MYMEM_MCP_TOKEN`) but initially did **not** check the token per
request — an HTTP smoke connected with no token and was served everything. **Fix:**
`BearerAuthMiddleware` (`on_request` → `get_http_headers(include_all=True)` → `authorize_request`)
rejects unauthenticated HTTP calls; stdio/local (no HTTP headers) passes through. Verified: client
without token → denied (`McpError`), with token → served.

**FastMCP 3.4.2 specifics worth remembering:**
- Transports: `"http"` (= streamable-http), `"stdio"`, `"sse"`; default HTTP mount path `/mcp`.
- `get_http_headers()` **filters** sensitive headers by default — pass `include_all=True` to see
  `Authorization`.
- Client bearer auth: `Client(url, auth="<token>")`.
- `run(transport=..., show_banner=False, **transport_kwargs)` — host/port go via kwargs.

**Lessons:**
- An MCP server must run correctly **from any working directory** — MCP hosts launch it from
  elsewhere. Anchor to the project explicitly; never assume the CWD or trust the host's `cwd` field.
- On stdio, treat **stdout as sacred** (protocol only). All human-facing output goes to stderr.
- A logging/IO sink failure must never take down a long-running server — degrade, don't crash.
- "Fail-closed at startup" is not authentication. Gate **every request**, and prove it with a
  no-credentials smoke that expects a denial.
- Reproduce the real host environment (foreign CWD, real client parsing stdout) — unit + in-memory
  tests were all green while the Claude Desktop launch still failed three different ways.
